# Details

WNF = Window Not Found
* For some reason, ReadScreen will report that the window is not found at some point, as if the window is deactivaed.
* Maybe some oher random window popped up and stole the focus.
* No other window was found when this error was seen, supposedly long afer the error happened.


SGL = Still Grabbing Loot
```
Roy's note:
- The loot was still grabbed by the mouse when this happened.
- There are two bugs:
  1. The 3rd left click which was intended to put the loot back into its inventory slot didn't work.
     This is because the mouse grabs the middle of the item.
     Putting it back to the top left slot can overlap with the cube and still mean putting into the cube,
     not put back to the inventory.
  2. With the loot grabbed, when trying to close the inventory and test its state,
     IsInventoryOpen() checks the bottom right statue, which happens to be covered by the loot.
